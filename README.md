# aims_inference

`aims_inference` is a tool for estimating an individual's genetic ancestry from a set of ancestry-informative markers (AIMs). The package comes with a pre-trained classifier that takes a specific set of 45 AIMs as input and outputs a genetic ancestry prediction at the level of continental superpopulation. New classfiers can also be trained using the 1000 genomes project for different sets of AIMs. 

## Installation

The first step in using the tool is to create and activate a local python environment with the required python packages. This can be done several ways (ex. `conda`) but we demonstrate here with `venv`.

First, locally clone the package into a working directory:
`git clone `
